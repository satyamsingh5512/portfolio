## Overview

Formlytics is a modern, product-first SaaS form builder positioned as a clean alternative to Google Forms. Built with a minimal black-and-white design language, it focuses on simplicity and speed while delivering powerful form creation, quiz building, and response collection capabilities.

The platform embodies a "build fast, deploy faster" philosophy with no distractions—just a serious tool for serious work.

## Architecture

Built on Next.js 14 App Router with a full-stack TypeScript architecture. The backend leverages MongoDB with Prisma ORM for flexible schema management and efficient queries. Authentication is handled through NextAuth.js v4 with Prisma Adapter for seamless user management.

State management uses Zustand for lightweight, performant client-side state, while Zod provides TypeScript-first schema validation across the application.
