## Project Overview

**Ubuntu Clipboard Manager** is a Linux-native clipboard management application designed to enhance productivity by providing a robust, persistent history of your clipboard interactions. Built using Electron and React, it bridges the gap between web technologies and native system integration, offering a seamless experience for Ubuntu and Debian-based systems.

## Key Features

### Real-Time Clipboard Monitoring
Automatically tracks text and image clipboard changes at the OS level, preventing duplicate entries to optimize storage and ensuring you never lose a copied item.

### Persistent History & Storage
Stores your clipboard history locally using **SQLite**, allowing you to access previously copied content even after a system restart. The local-first approach ensures complete privacy and offline availability.

### Global Shortcuts & Tray Integration
- **System-wide Activation**: Access your clipboard history instantly from any application using customizable global hotkeys.
- **Tray Icon**: Runs quietly in the background with a system tray icon for one-click access and minimal resource usage.

### Privacy & Security
Designed with privacy in mind, the application offers options to exclude sensitive applications (like password managers) and allows for manual or automatic history clearing.

## Tech Stack

### Desktop Application
- **Electron.js**: Cross-platform framework for deep system integration.
- **React.js**: Component-based UI for a responsive and modern interface.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling for a clean, consistent look.

### System & Data
- **SQLite**: Lightweight, serverless local database for efficient history storage.
- **Linux System APIs**: Utilizes `libnotify` for native notifications and global shortcut APIs for system-wide control.
- **Packaging**: Distributed as **Flatpak** and **AppImage** for universal Linux compatibility.

## Installation

> [!NOTE]
> **Coming Soon**
> The installation packages (Flatpak and AppImage) are currently being finalized and will be available for download shortly.
