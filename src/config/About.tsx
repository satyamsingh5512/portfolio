  description: `Hey, I'm Satyam. I'm a 3rd-year B.Tech Computer Science student and a Full-Stack Developer with strong Machine Learning expertise, focused on building scalable, production-ready systems.

I work across the entire stack, from designing robust backend architectures and APIs to building clean, high-performance user interfaces. Alongside this, I actively develop and experiment with machine learning models for real-world applications, with interests spanning neural networks, natural language processing, intelligent systems, and data-driven decision-making.

I enjoy solving complex problems at scale, optimizing system performance, and turning ideas into reliable, user-centric products. My goal is to engineer systems that are efficient, secure, and impactful in real-world environments.
